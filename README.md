# Meta-Continual-Learning


In every folder there should be a python file.

For execution, please run ___.py

Please note that the files with _Omni are for the omniglot dataset and the ones without are for the incremental sine wave dataset.
The code is not speed optimized and therefore might run slowly on CPUs

For questions, comments, concerns and errors, please email krm9c@outlook.com

Especially for errors please email.

Thank you
